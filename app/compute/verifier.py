"""
Numeric Verifier — a regex-based, non-LLM check that every number appearing
in the Composer's output text actually came from the facts payload. This is
the hard enforcement mechanism behind "the solution should not generate any
number" — the Composer prompt asks nicely, this makes sure.

If a stray number is found, the caller should NOT ship the LLM's text —
fall back to a template-rendered answer built directly from the facts
payload (see render_template_fallback), which has no LLM in the loop at all.
